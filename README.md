# Big Picture Cataloguer

The Big Picture Cataloguer is a tool for downloading Boston.com's _Big Picture_ photojournalism series. 

It was originally conceived and implemented on a drunken weekend some time in 2010. As a result, its codebase left a lot to be desired.

This repository is a new, re-written, clean and (mostly) tested implementation.
